# nicksshorts
An R package with some convenience functions for graphing and data cleaning

Install with `remotes::install_github('NickCH-K/nicksshorts')` (if you don't have the remotes package, then do `install.packages('remotes')` first).

See all the functions with `help(package = 'nicksshorts')`.

This is a package I will add to according to my personal needs, as this is a package I built for my own convenience. I probably won't fulfill any feature requests, unless you happen to suggest something that *I* want to use but didn't think of.
